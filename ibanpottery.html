    <p align="center">Description:<br>
        <br>The pottery in Sarawak today, falls into two distinct categories, each with its own history and traditions. The pottery, which is made <br>by a few Iban, Murut and Kelabit potters, is the common hand-moulded, low fired pottery and generally associated with the art of <br>various people of South East Asia. Construction is by the paddle an anvil method and the forms are small and utilitarian in nature. <br>Pottery of this sort appears in archaeological excavations in Sarawak alongside with other cultural materials, which is up to one <br>thousand year old, although it has yet to be definitely established whether this pottery tradition is continuous and unbroken up to the present day.<br>The second type of pottery is made by Chinese potters, descendants of immigrants from the famous pottery producing area <br>around the town Swatow in Kwangtung Province. These pots (periok), originated from Nanga Sumpah, Batang Ai, Sri Aman, Sarawak created <br>by the only few villagers inherited the skill from their grand grandfather. Hence, it has a traditional value.</p>
