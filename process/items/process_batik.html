            <h2>Step 1</h2>
            <p>The first wax is applied over the penciled-in outline of the pattern. Almost always the original cloth is white or beige.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <img src="../../img/process/step2-batik.jpg" alt="Step 2">
            <h2>Step 2</h2>
            <p>The cloth is dyed in the first dye bath. In this case the first dyebath is indigo blue. The area of the cloth where the wax was applied in Step 1 will remain white.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <img src="../../img/process/step3-batik.jpg" alt="Step 3">
            <h2>Step 3</h2>
            <p>Second application of wax is applied. In this case it is a dark brown color. A poorer quality of wax is used to cover larger areas of cloth. The darker color helps to differentiate it from the first wax applied. Any parts that are covered with this wax application will remain the indigo color.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <img src="../../img/process/step4-batik.jpg" alt="Step 4">
            <h2>Step 4</h2>
            <p>The cloth is dyed in the second dye bath. In this case it is a navy blue. Any areas that are not covered by wax will become dark blue.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <img src="../../img/process/step5-batik.jpg" alt="Step 5">
            <h2>Step 5</h2>
            <p>All the wax that has been applied thus far is removed. This is done by heating the wax and scraping it off and also by applying hot water and sponging off the remaining wax.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <img src="../../img/process/step6-batik.jpg" alt="Step 6">
            <h2>Step 6</h2>
            <p>Wax is applied to the area of the fabric that the artist wishes to remain the indigo blue color.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">

            <h2>Step 8</h2>
            <p>The fabric is submerged in the final dye bath. In this case it is brown. Any areas of the cloth that have not been covered with wax will become brown.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
