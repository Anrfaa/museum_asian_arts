        <h1>DIY Puppet shadows Process</h1>
        <p>Here are the DIY steps of making puppet shadows</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <div class="card">
            <img src="../../img/process/step1-puppet.jpg" alt="Step 1">
            <h2>Step 1</h2>
            <p>Now traditional puppets are made from animal skin but we are going to make ours from cardstock.  If you wanted to make the transparent type you can adapt this project by using a heavy duty transparency sheet (photocopy the template directly on to it)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <img src="../../img/process/step2-puppet.jpg" alt="Step 2">
            <h2>Step 2</h2>
            <p>Let's add some color, even though you won't see this in the shadow these puppets are works of art, so let's make them as appealing even when they are just waiting to be played with.
            Paint in the details and then use a fine sharpie for outlining and definition.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <img src="../../img/process/step3-puppet.jpg" alt="Step 3">
            <h2>Step 3</h2>
            <p>Cut out all the pieces to your puppet.To add some embellishment add a piece of a gold doily.Using a single hole punch, press punch or even tip of a knitting needle punch a hole in all the little circles on the pattern.  You can also add some extra holes for decoration (look good in the shadow). </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <img src="../../img/process/step4-puppet.jpg" alt="Step 4">
            <h2>Step 4</h2>
            <p>Using a single hole punch, press punch or even tip of a knitting needle punch a hole in all the little circles on the pattern.These are the joints it can have some movement in your puppet.  Attach some paper fasteners. If the ends from the large fasteners are too long just fold back on itself or you can trim them off with scissors.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <img src="../../img/process/step5-puppet.jpg" alt="Step 5">
            <h2>Step 5</h2>
            <p>Attach the main part of your puppet to a skewer. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <img src="../../img/process/step6-puppet.jpg" alt="Step 6">
            <h2>Step 6</h2>
            <p>Then wrapped the string around the wrist of the puppet as tight as wanted and tied it off.  This enables the stir stick to sideways from the arm which makes the puppet easier to manipulate. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <img src="../../img/process/step7-puppet.jpg" alt="Step 7">
            <h2>Step 7</h2>
            <p>Now the best way to attach the wooden coffee stir sticks to the arms is by string.  You can get better movement for your puppet. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">

            <h2>Step </h2>
            <p>And that's it! Check in google and you can find many images of Wayang Kulit characters as well as some of the traditional plays and you can build your own little puppet troupe. </p>
