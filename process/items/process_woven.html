            <h2>Step 1</h2>
            <p>Leaves that are quite old are cut at the base one by one, starting at the main tuber. The leaves that have been cut are then trimmed at the ends to remove parts that are tapered and cannot be split, and so that all the leaves are almost the same length. Next, the leaves are spread over the coals of a small fire until they wilt.</p>

            <h2>Step 2</h2>
            <p>The leaves are spread over a fire or can also be dried in the hot sun until they are completely dry and wilted. The goal is to kill leaf cells and get rid of the water contained in them. After the leaves wither, the spines on the spine and wings of the melon are removed with a piece of coir fiber stretched between the thumb and forefinger.</p>

            <h2>Step 3</h2>
            <p>If the back spines of a leaf are removed, the leaf will automatically split into two. The slits are then split again according to the desired width with a tool called a compass.</p>

            <h2>Step 4</h2>
            <p>On the third or fourth day, the blades are taken out and washed and rinsed thoroughly before drying in the sun. Blades that are dry enough will turn white.</p>

            <h2>Step 5</h2>
            <p>The leaves of the pandan are colored by dipping, that is, boiling them with a dye for several minutes. In the past, only three colors were popular, namely red, green and yellow because the dyes for these colors were easy to find. The red color comes from the kesumba tree, green comes from the bemban leaves, and yellow comes from the turmeric leaves. However, now dyes of various colors are sold widely. When it has been dyed and dried in the sun until dry, the blades are washed one last time to make them smoother and softer.</p>

            <p>The way the weaving begins depends on the type of object you want to produce and the decorative pattern chosen. Mat weaving, for example, can be started in the middle or at the vertices. However, for food hoods, the weaving must start at the cone-shaped peak. The peak cone can be hung or extended to continue the weave of the serving hood.</p>

            <p>The woven pattern is generally called kelarai. Kelarai is made in various motifs and its role is the same as floral patterns in weaving, namely as a characteristic of jewelry. The woven kelarai is arranged singly and loosely (all over) or arranged in a certain space. The vertical arrangement is called standing kelarai and the sendeng arrangement, oblique kelarai. For side or ledge decoration, there is also a special curtain, namely bamboo shoot shoots.</p>
